# First Steps
### I downloaded the data iris set as a csv from: 
(https://datahub.io/machine-learning/iris)
### I was having difficulty getting the data set from the URL provided in the project lesson plan. t wouldn't work on my computer. The above link was mentioned by:
(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-basics-of-pandas-using-iris-dataset/)
### There is lots of interesting information in that link too. 
### Other references:

### I also created a python file called irisdataset, in which I read in the csv file and tested it to make sure it was working. 
### I created the Project repository on Git Hub and linked it up on my computer.
